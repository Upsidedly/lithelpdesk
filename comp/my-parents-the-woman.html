    <h1>Comparative Analysis: <em>My Parents</em> vs <em>The Woman Speaks to the Man Who Has Employed Her Son</em></h1>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Stephen Spender’s <em>My Parents</em> and Lorna Goodison’s <em>The Woman Speaks to the Man Who Has Employed Her
            Son</em>
        explore the complex and emotional relationships between parents and children, especially in the face of societal
        dangers
        and personal limitations. While Spender’s speaker reflects on his parents’ failed attempts to protect him from
        bullying, Goodison’s speaker laments the fate of her son, who despite her efforts, is drawn into a life of
        violence.
        Both poems use vivid imagery, emotive tone, and symbolic language to explore <strong>parenthood, societal
            failure,
            childhood trauma, and loss</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Parental Love and Protection</h4>
    <p>
        Both poems center around parents trying to protect their children from harm, though with different outcomes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In <em>My Parents</em>, the speaker begins, “<strong>My parents kept me from children who were
                rough</strong>.” The phrase
            suggests both protection and restriction. The parents’ intent is love-driven but may have caused unintended
            isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
            In Goodison’s poem, the mother describes, “<strong>She carried him like the poor / carry hope</strong>,”
            expressing a deep,
            sacrificial love. She raises her son with dreams of him becoming a “<strong>doctor, / earth healer, pilot
                take wings</strong>,”
            showing both maternal devotion and high hopes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Social and Emotional Powerlessness</h4>
    <p>
        Both parents are ultimately powerless to shield their children from larger societal forces.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spender’s speaker is still bullied and mocked despite his parents’ protection. He is physically assaulted
            and
            emotionally scarred, shown in lines like “<strong>I feared more than tigers their muscles like
                iron</strong>” and
            “<strong>They threw mud / While I looked the other way, pretending to smile</strong>.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Goodison’s mother is “<strong>prepared, she is done</strong>,” having “<strong>no power over you and this /
                at the level of earth</strong>.”
            Her only weapons are “<strong>prayers and a mother’s tears</strong>,” highlighting the futility of her
            efforts in a violent,
            patriarchal society.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Tone and Perspective</h4>
    <p>
        Both poems employ reflective and sorrowful tones to express regret and helplessness.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spender uses a <strong>conflicted and introspective tone</strong>, shown in the final line: “<strong>I
                longed to forgive them
                but they never smiled</strong>.” It captures the speaker’s complex emotions of fear, bitterness, and a
            desire for closure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Goodison’s poem shifts from <strong>hopeful to mournful and accusatory</strong>, ending in a resigned,
            tragic tone
            with the biblical cry “<strong>Absalom</strong>,” evoking grief for a lost son and referencing David’s
            mourning for his
            rebellious child.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Use of Symbolism and Imagery</h4>
    <p>
        Symbolism is key in both poems to express deeper emotional and societal realities.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spender uses striking imagery such as “<strong>They sprang out behind hedges / Like dogs to bark at my
                world</strong>” to portray
            the boys as animalistic and hostile. The metaphor “<strong>salt coarse pointing</strong>” gives mockery a
            physical sting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Goodison uses metaphors like “<strong>draw his bloody salary</strong>” and “<strong>one whole submachine /
                gun for him alone</strong>”
            to show how society’s structures push young men into violence. The “<strong>three and one-third yards of
                black cloth</strong>”
            symbolizes her preparation for her son’s funeral, though he is still alive.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Gender Roles and Responsibility</h4>
    <p>
        Both poems explore the burden of parental roles, but especially focus on mothers.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In <em>My Parents</em>, both parents are involved, but the focus remains on actions over emotional
            engagement.
            The parental role is protective, but emotionally distant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Goodison’s mother “<strong>raise him twice, once as mother / Then as father</strong>,” underscoring the
            <strong>double burden</strong>
            women often face, especially in single-parent households. Her pain is intensified by abandonment and the
            weight of dual roles.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        Though Spender and Goodison write from different cultures and eras, their poems share a common exploration of
        the
        limitations of parental protection in a flawed society. Whether through physical separation or spiritual
        despair, both
        poems emphasize how societal forces—poverty, violence, class, and gender expectations—can overpower even the
        most
        loving efforts of parents. Their reflective tones and symbolic imagery invite readers to mourn not just
        individual
        fates, but the systems that perpetuate these losses.
