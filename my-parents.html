    <h1><i>My Parents</i></h1>
    <p><sub>&#9;Steven Spender</sub></p>

    <pre>
My parents kept me from children who were rough
Who threw words like stones and wore torn clothes
Their thighs showed through rags they ran in the street
And climbed cliffs and stripped by the country streams.

I feared more than tigers their muscles like iron
Their jerking hands and their knees tight on my arms
I feared the salt coarse pointing of those boys
Who copied my lisp behind me on the road.

They were lithe they sprang out behind hedges
Like dogs to bark at my world. They threw mud
While I looked the other way, pretending to smile.
I longed to forgive them but they never smiled.</pre>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Stephen Spender’s <em>My Parents</em> explores the tension between parental protection and social reality. The
        speaker recalls how his parents, hoping to shield him from rough, working-class children, instead left him
        vulnerable to bullying and isolation. These boys mocked his speech, physically assaulted him, and represented a
        kind of brutal freedom he both feared and envied. Though his parents tried to separate him from danger, their
        actions reinforced class divides and may have intensified the bullying. The speaker’s tone is reflective and
        conflicted, suggesting both admiration for and alienation from the boys who tormented him.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Main themes:</strong> Class conflict, childhood trauma, bullying, parental influence, social isolation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tone:</strong> Reflective, bitter, conflicted, introspective.</p>

    <h2>Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>

    <h5>"My parents kept me from children who were rough"</h5>
    <p>
        An opening that places blame or credit on the parents. The word "kept" suggests both protection and restriction.
        The adjective "rough" implies physical danger but also social class prejudice, drawing a divide between the
        speaker and these boys.
    </p>

    <h5>"Who threw words like stones and wore torn clothes"</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>simile</strong> likening verbal abuse to physical violence. The boys' insults hurt emotionally, just
        as stones cause physical injury. Their "torn clothes" signify poverty and neglect, adding to the class contrast.
    </p>

    <h5>"Their thighs showed through rags they ran in the street / And climbed cliffs and stripped by the country
        streams."</h5>
    <p>
        The boys' freedom is highlighted through active verbs like “ran,” “climbed,” and “stripped.” Though poor, they
        possess a wild, energetic life that the speaker seems to both fear and admire. The repetition of physical
        imagery suggests envy of their strength and vitality.
    </p>

    <h5>"I feared more than tigers their muscles like iron"</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>hyperbole</strong> and <strong>simile</strong> to express exaggerated fear. Comparing the boys’
        strength to "tigers" and "iron" suggests not just intimidation but also admiration. They are animalistic and
        powerful.
    </p>

    <h5>"Their jerking hands and their knees tight on my arms"</h5>
    <p>
        A moment of physical dominance. The boys literally pin the speaker down. This describes real, traumatic bullying
        and highlights his helplessness.
    </p>

    <h5>"I feared the salt coarse pointing of those boys"</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>metaphor</strong> that makes mockery feel tactile. “Salt coarse” implies abrasiveness and emotional
        pain, like rubbing salt into wounds. It links emotional harm to physical sensation.
    </p>

    <h5>"Who copied my lisp behind me on the road."</h5>
    <p>
        A clear example of mockery. His speech impediment is a source of ridicule and shows the cruelty of the boys. It
        also reveals his vulnerability, deepening the reader’s sympathy.
    </p>

    <h5>"They were lithe they sprang out behind hedges / Like dogs to bark at my world."</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>simile</strong> comparing the boys to dogs. They are described as animalistic, predatory, and hostile
        to his “world” — a metaphor for his social class. “Bark” suggests rejection and aggression.
    </p>

    <h5>"They threw mud / While I looked the other way, pretending to smile."</h5>
    <p>
        The speaker attempts to mask discomfort with a forced smile. This line reflects both passivity and a desire to
        de-escalate. The phrase “pretending to smile” reveals internal suffering masked by social performance.
    </p>

    <h5>"I longed to forgive them but they never smiled."</h5>
    <p>
        A final line that conveys emotional isolation. Though the speaker desires reconciliation or understanding, the
        boys offer no kindness in return. This unreciprocated longing deepens the sense of trauma and unresolved class
        tension.
