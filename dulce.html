    <h1><i>Dulce et Decorum Est</i></h1>
    <p><sub>&#9;Wilfred Owen</sub></p>

    <pre>
        Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
        Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
        Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
        And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
        Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
        But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
        Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
        Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.
        
        Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,
        Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
        But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
        And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—
        Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
        As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
        
        In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
        He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
        
        If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
        Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
        And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
        His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;
        If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
        Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
        Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
        Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues—
        My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
        To children ardent for some desperate glory,
        The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
        Pro patria mori.
          </pre>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Wilfred Owen’s <em>Dulce et Decorum Est</em> is a brutal condemnation of war. Drawing from his own experiences
        in the trenches of World War I, Owen describes the physical and emotional devastation of soldiers. The poem
        follows a group of exhausted men who are caught in a gas attack, and one soldier who dies in agony because he
        cannot put on his gas mask in time. The vivid horror of this moment haunts the speaker and fuels his rejection
        of the old patriotic idea that it is noble to die for one’s country.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Main themes:</strong> War, trauma, propaganda, disillusionment, patriotism.</p>
    <p><strong>Tone:</strong> Bitter, mournful, accusatory.</p>

    <h2>Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>

    <h5>"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks"</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>simile</strong> comparing soldiers to beggars. This image strips away the glory of war and shows the
        men as broken, burdened, and aged by their suffering.
    </p>

    <h5>"Knock-kneed, coughing like hags..."</h5>
    <p>
        Another <strong>simile</strong> likening their coughing to that of sick old women. The line continues the theme
        of the soldiers' physical ruin. The phrase "knock-kneed" shows how unstable and crippled they’ve become.
    </p>

    <h5>"Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs..."</h5>
    <p>
        The “haunting flares” evoke the explosions of the battlefield. The soldiers are leaving this horror behind as
        they march slowly toward rest.
    </p>

    <h5>"Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, But limped on, blood-shod."</h5>
    <p>
        The soldiers are so exhausted it’s as if they are sleepwalking. “Blood-shod” is a powerful metaphor, showing
        their feet are covered in blood like shoes.
    </p>

    <h5>"All went lame; all blind; Drunk with fatigue..."</h5>
    <p>
        They’re so overtaken by exhaustion that they seem blind, lame, and senseless—“drunk” not with alcohol, but with
        fatigue.
    </p>

    <h5>"Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling..."</h5>
    <p>
        Panic erupts as poison gas is released. The phrase “ecstasy of fumbling” is <strong>ironic</strong>: “ecstasy”
        usually means joy, but here it refers to frenzied panic as they scramble to survive.
    </p>

    <h5>"But someone still was yelling out and stumbling..."</h5>
    <p>
        One man fails to get his mask on in time. He’s described with the <strong>simile</strong> “like a man in fire or
        lime,” emphasizing his agony.
    </p>

    <h5>"As under a green sea, I saw him drowning."</h5>
    <p>
        A <strong>simile</strong> comparing the thick green gas to a sea. The man’s choking is likened to drowning,
        making the horror visual and suffocating.
    </p>

    <h5>"He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning."</h5>
    <p>
        This haunting line shows how the experience lives on in the speaker’s nightmares. The verbs are brutal and
        relentless.
    </p>

    <h5>"If you could hear... the blood / Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs..."</h5>
    <p>
        Owen challenges the reader directly. He describes the dying man in grotesque detail: gargling blood, ruined
        lungs, and incurable sores. The <strong>similes</strong> “obscene as cancer” and “bitter as the cud” highlight
        the unnatural and revolting nature of the death.
    </p>

    <h5>"My friend, you would not tell with such high zest..."</h5>
    <p>
        Owen ends with biting sarcasm, attacking those who glorify war. He cites the Latin phrase <em>Dulce et decorum
            est pro patria mori</em>—“It is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country”—and calls it “the old Lie.” His
        message is clear: war is not sweet, and dying in it is not noble.
