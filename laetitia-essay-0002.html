    <h1>Life of Laetitia Essay #0002</h1>
    <blockquote> <b>Parental figures shape the direction of a child’s life.</b><br> Write an essay in which you compare
        the parenting styles of TWO adults from the novel. In your essay, assess how their approach affects ONE child
        and discuss how the author uses contrast to make this point. </blockquote>
    <p> In <em>For the Life of Laetitia</em> by Merle Hodge, the contrasting parenting styles of Cephas and Ma significantly
        shape the development of Michael, Cephas’ son. Cephas is authoritarian and emotionally neglectful, while Ma is
        nurturing and firm. The impact of their parenting is most evident in the difference between Michael and Lacey,
        Cephas’ children, and in Michael’s growth after he is influenced by Ma’s values through Lacey. The author uses
        contrast to underscore the transformative power of positive parenting and the consequences of neglect. </p>
    <p> Cephas is a controlling and emotionally absent father. Initially uninterested in Lacey’s life, he only shows
        interest when she gains entrance to a government secondary school. He exercises harsh authority in his household
        and expects obedience without nurturing emotional support. Cephas’ approach stifles Lacey’s growth and
        well-being, and his household environment contributes to her eventual nervous breakdown. Meanwhile, his son
        Michael—raised entirely under Cephas' influence—is rude, untidy, inconsiderate, and unhelpful. He lacks the
        discipline and emotional intelligence that would help him relate respectfully to others. </p>
    <p> By contrast, Ma, Lacey’s grandmother, is the respected matriarch in her rural household. Her parenting style is
        characterized by love, discipline, and encouragement. She ensures that Lacey is well-behaved, neat, and
        considerate, instilling in her the importance of education and self-worth. When Lacey comes to live in Cephas’
        household during term time, she carries with her Ma’s values and begins to influence Michael positively. Lacey
        gently but firmly teaches him to be tidier and more considerate. Through this, we see Michael begin to change,
        proving that environment and guidance, not just blood, shape a child’s behavior. </p>
    <p> The author uses this contrast in parenting styles to highlight the novel’s theme: children thrive under support
        and discipline, but suffer under neglect. Cephas’ harshness produces a son with poor manners and a daughter who
        experiences a breakdown, while Ma’s love produces a strong, hopeful child who tries to help others, including
        Michael. The transformation in Michael, sparked by Lacey’s presence, reinforces this point: given the right
        guidance, even a neglected child can begin to change. </p>
    <p> In conclusion, Merle Hodge demonstrates that the direction of a child’s life is deeply influenced by the nature
        of their parental figures. The contrast between Cephas and Ma highlights this: Cephas’ emotional absence fosters
        dysfunction, while Ma’s warmth fosters strength. Through this, the author shows that love, support, and
        values—not authority alone—are what truly shape a child. </p>
