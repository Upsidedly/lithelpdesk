    <blockquote>
        <b>Parental figures shape the direction of a child’s life.</b><br>
        Write an essay in which you compare the parenting styles of TWO adults from the novel. In your essay, assess
        how their approach affects ONE child and discuss how the author uses contrast to make this point.

    <p>
        A child’s future can either be stunted or uplifted by the kind of parenting they receive. In Merle Hodge’s novel
        <i>For the Life of Laetitia</i>, two adult figures — Cephas and Lacey — offer drastically different models of
        parenting,
        both of which significantly affect the development of Michael, Cephas’ son. While Cephas is a cold,
        authoritarian father who
        fails to nurture his children emotionally or socially, Lacey presents a warm, firm, and consistent approach to
        parenting
        that encourages discipline and growth. Through the contrast between these two figures, Hodge emphasizes that the
        success
        and character of a child are not only shaped by blood relations, but by the presence of positive, supportive
        guidance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cephas’ parenting style is harsh, neglectful, and rooted in patriarchal control. He is often described as
        self-important
        and arrogant, with a clear disdain for emotional connection and a limited view of what children, especially
        boys, should be.
        His parenting is more about maintaining dominance and order than about cultivating love or understanding. As a
        result, Michael,
        who is raised under his influence, becomes ill-mannered, unhygienic, and inconsiderate. He shows no respect for
        his personal
        space or for others, especially women, reflecting Cephas’ own dismissive behavior. This begins to establish in
        Michael a warped
        sense of masculinity and an unhealthy pattern of behaviour that could lead him to become just as oppressive as
        his father.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, Lacey’s parenting is marked by emotional intelligence, patience, and quiet strength. Although
        not Michael’s
        biological parent, Lacey assumes the role of a caregiver when she moves in with Cephas. Unlike him, she takes
        the time to
        gently correct Michael’s behavior, teaching him to be tidy, respectful, and responsible. She provides discipline
        without
        cruelty and shows that love does not have to be loud or aggressive to be effective. Importantly, Lacey does not
        mirror Cephas’
        authoritarianism — instead, she sets boundaries while maintaining empathy. As a result, Michael begins to
        change: he becomes
        more helpful, aware of his behavior, and open to growth. This demonstrates the impact a nurturing environment
        can have, even
        when a child has already been shaped by a negative one.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hodge uses contrast between Cephas and Lacey to emphasize the transformative power of parenting. Cephas
        represents the old-world,
        emotionally distant father figure whose presence harms more than helps. Lacey, meanwhile, embodies the positive
        maternal presence
        that encourages growth and healing. The juxtaposition of their approaches creates a clear narrative message:
        that children become
        the product of what they are exposed to, and while neglect breeds resentment and disorder, love and discipline
        can foster
        maturity and self-respect.
    </p>

    <p>
        In conclusion, Cephas’ neglectful, overbearing parenting style sets Michael on a path of emotional
        underdevelopment and poor
        social behavior. Lacey’s gentle but firm intervention, however, redirects him towards becoming a more respectful
        and responsible
        person. Through the contrast between these two parental figures, Hodge underscores that a child’s character is
        not predestined
        but is instead shaped by the adults who raise them — for better or for worse.
