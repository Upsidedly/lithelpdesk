    <h1>CSEC Poetry Essay Guide</h1>

    <h2>Essay Structure (Always 3 Parts)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Describe:</strong> What happens in each poem?</li>
        <li><strong>Discuss:</strong> What is the speaker‚Äôs tone or attitude?</li>
        <li><strong>Examine:</strong> One device used to convey meaning in each poem.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with a <strong>hook</strong> that applies to both poems.</li>
        <li><strong>Name both poems</strong> and clearly link them to the theme.</li>
        <li>Briefly touch on the answer to all three parts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Parenting is perhaps the most difficult job an adult can face. It often forces hard choices. This is true for
        the poems ‚ÄúLittle Boy Crying‚Äù by Merlyn Morris and ‚ÄúThe Woman Speaks to the Man Who Has Employed Her Son‚Äù by
        Lorna Goodison. The former shows a father forced to discipline his son; the latter shows a mother forced to give
        up. Morris uses diction to show discomfort; Goodison uses biblical allusion to express loss.</p>

    <h2>Body Paragraphs (Use P.E.E.)</h2>
    <p>Each paragraph should compare both poems for one part of the question. Use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Point:</strong> Answer the question with a topic sentence using keywords like "describe", "impact",
            or "challenge".</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Include specific quotes (not just one repeated all the time).</li>
        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Explain how the evidence supports the point.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>‚ö† Common Mistakes to Avoid:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No hook or one that doesn‚Äôt apply to both poems.</li>
            <li>Uneven paragraphs ‚Äì both poems must be discussed in every body paragraph.</li>
            <li>Just retelling the poem instead of describing, discussing, and examining.</li>
            <li>Not quoting the poem or using weak analysis.</li>
            <li>Reusing the same quote in every paragraph.</li>
            <li>Not using transitional words like ‚ÄúSimilarly‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn the other hand‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIn contrast‚Äù.</li>
            <li>Not using topic sentences pulled from the question itself.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>


    <h2>Poetic Devices to Use<br><sub>(Choose based on the question)</sub></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Vivid pictures created by descriptive language.</li>
        <li><strong>Juxtaposition:</strong> Two contrasting ideas or images (e.g., how the boy sees his dad vs. how the
            dad really feels).</li>
        <li><strong>Allusion:</strong> Reference to well-known stories (e.g., Absalom = rebellious son).</li>
        <li><strong>Oxymoron:</strong> Two contradictory terms used together (e.g., ‚Äúbloody salary‚Äù).</li>
        <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Direct comparison (e.g., ‚Äúgrim giant‚Äù as the father).</li>
        <li><strong>Pun / Wordplay:</strong> Words with multiple meanings (e.g., ‚Äúcarried him under her heart‚Äù).</li>
        <li><strong>Diction:</strong> Word choice, especially emotionally charged words like ‚Äúscald‚Äù.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don‚Äôt just repeat the introduction.</li>
        <li>Give <strong>your final thoughts</strong> on the issue or theme, not just a summary.</li>
        <li><strong>Level up</strong>: End powerfully. No "in conclusion" needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Parenting is filled with painful decisions. Whether it‚Äôs punishment or surrender, both poems show that being a
        parent is never easy. The poets reveal this through diction, allusion, and emotional tone.</p>

    <h2>Linking Words (Comparative)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Similarly</li>
        <li>On the other hand</li>
        <li>In contrast</li>
        <li>Whereas</li>
        <li>Both poems reveal...</li>
    </ul>
