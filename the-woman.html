    <h1><i>The Woman Speaks to the Man Who Has Employed Her Son</i></h1>
    <p><sub>Lorna Goodison</sub></p>

    <pre>
Her son was first made known to her 
as a sense of unease, a need to cry 
for little reasons and a metallic tide 
rising in her mouth each morning. 
Such signs made her know 
That she was not alone in her body. 
She carried him full term 
tight up under her heart. 

She carried him like the poor 
carry hope, hope you get a break 
or a visa, hope one child go through 
and remember you. He had no father. 
The man she made him with had more 
like him, he was fair-minded 
he treated all his children 
with equal and unbiased indifference. 

She raise him twice, once as mother 
Then as father, set no ceiling 
On what he could be doctor, 
earth healer, pilot take wings. 
But now he tells her he is working 
for you, that you value him so much 
you give him one whole submachine 
gun for him alone. 

He says you are like a father to him 
she is wondering what kind of father 
would give a son hot and exploding 
death, when he asks him for bread. 
She went downtown and bought three 
and one-third yards of black cloth 
and a deep crowned and veiled hat 
for the day he draw his bloody salary. 

She has no power over you and this 
at the level of earth, what she has 
are prayers and a mother’s tears 
and at knee city she uses them. 
She says psalms for him 
she reads psalms for you 
she weeps for his soul 
her eyewater covers you. 

She is throwing a partner 
with Judas Iscariot’s mother 
the thief on the left-hand side 
of the cross, his mother 
is the banker, her draw though 
is first and last for she still 
throwing two hands as mother and 
father. 
She is prepared, she is done. Absalom.
    </pre>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The poem is a monologue from a mother reflecting on her son's life and the man who led him astray. She speaks with sorrow and bitterness, revealing her son has fallen into a life of violence and crime. Despite raising him alone with high hopes, he now views a criminal figure—or possibly a corrupt authority—as a father. She prepares herself spiritually and emotionally for his inevitable death, placing her trust in prayer where earthly power has failed her.

    <h2>Line-by-Line Analysis</h2>

    <h5>"Her son was first made known to her / as a sense of unease..."</h5>
    <p>
        Symbolic of morning sickness but also foreshadows the emotional pain to come. The diction "not alone in her body" carries deep emotional weight and introduces the theme of maternal connection.
    </p>

    <h5>"She carried him full term / tight up under her heart."</h5>
    <p>
        A metaphor suggesting both literal pregnancy and deep emotional attachment. Also a double entendre—both physically close and emotionally dear.
    </p>

    <h5>"She carried him like the poor / carry hope..."</h5>
    <p>
        A powerful simile. Just as the poor desperately cling to hope, she holds onto her son with similar desperation and optimism.
    </p>

    <h5>"He had no father. / The man she made him with..."</h5>
    <p>
        This matter-of-fact tone highlights the father's absence and indifference. Sarcastic diction "equal and unbiased indifference" critiques the irresponsibility of absentee fathers.
    </p>

    <h5>"She raise him twice, once as mother / Then as father..."</h5>
    <p>
        She attempts to fill both parental roles, emphasizing the burden of single motherhood and societal gender expectations.
    </p>

    <h5>"...doctor, / earth healer, pilot take wings."</h5>
    <p>
        Hyperbolic and metaphorical—she saw unlimited potential in her son. These professions symbolize success, healing, and freedom.
    </p>

    <h5>"But now he tells her he is working / for you..."</h5>
    <p>
        Juxtaposition. Contrasts her dreams with the harsh reality. Ambiguity around "you"—could refer to a gang leader, corrupt official, or the state itself.
    </p>

    <h5>"...you give him one whole submachine / gun for him alone."</h5>
    <p>
        Sarcasm and horror combine. She mocks the twisted value placed on her son’s life—armed for death instead of supported for life.
    </p>

    <h5>"She is wondering what kind of father / would give a son hot and exploding / death..."</h5>
    <p>
        Biblical allusion to Matthew 7:9. Instead of nurturing, the “father figure” gives instruments of violence. A rhetorical question of spiritual and moral indictment.
    </p>

    <h5>"She went downtown and bought three / and one-third yards of black cloth..."</h5>
    <p>
        Foreshadowing. She is preparing for her son's funeral before he dies. The "deep crowned" hat is also a biblical allusion to the crown of thorns.
    </p>

    <h5>"She has no power over you... / at knee city she uses them."</h5>
    <p>
        The speaker acknowledges her earthly powerlessness but leans into spiritual resistance—symbolic of faith as the last refuge.
    </p>

    <h5>"She says psalms for him / she reads psalms for you..."</h5>
    <p>
        The mother prays for both her son and his employer. Her “eyewater”—a metaphor for tears—acts like a curse or blessing, depending on the reader's view.
    </p>

    <h5>"She is throwing a partner / with Judas Iscariot’s mother..."</h5>
    <p>
        A metaphor using the Caribbean “partner” saving system. It symbolizes loss and betrayal, shared with the mothers of traitors and thieves.
    </p>

    <h5>"...throwing two hands as mother and / father."</h5>
    <p>
        A pun—she’s battling spiritually with both roles. It highlights her exhaustion and the futility of trying to be both parents.
    </p>

    <h5>"She is prepared, she is done. Absalom."</h5>
    <p>
        A biblical allusion to David’s rebellious son. Signals mourning, betrayal, and inevitable loss. The final word “Absalom” is a poetic cry of grief.
