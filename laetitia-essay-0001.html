    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In order for someone to escape their circumstances, it is oftentimes necessary to give up what is most valuable
        in life — life itself. In the novel For the Life of Laetitia by Merle Hodge, several characters had a desire to escape
        their circumstances, or at the very least have them change for the better. These characters would go to extreme
        lengths with the hope of a change happening, often destroying their values, disregarding their morals, or
        causing themselves severe harm in the process. One character with this desire was Anjanee, who did not want to
        turn out like her mother. As a result, she tried to get an education but in the end committed suicide, and the
        writer uses the narrative
        technique foreshadowing to explore this desire.
        <br><br>
        Anjanee was in first year. She wanted to escape her father’s house so as to not become like her mother. She
        comes from a poor family and as such, it is difficult to raise funds to go to school. The lack of funds,
        compounded by her father’s and brothers’ insistence that she is to stay home and work, gradually make Anjanee
        more and more hopeless. Although initially she worked hard to raise money for bus fare because she was
        determined to get an education, she keeps falling behind in school due to having to miss school sometimes.
        Consequently, Anjanee starts to believe that she is wasting money going to school and she is going to end up
        like her mother irrespective of how hard she tries.
        <br><br>
        Her father and brothers promoted the ideology that a woman’s place is in the home cooking, washing and rearing
        children, and as such, tell Anjanee that she doesn’t need any more schooling since she can already cook, wash,
        read and write. Additionally, Anjanee sees the pressure her mother faces under all this and basically a slave —
        so Anjanee decides she would either get an education and move out with her mother, or die.
        <br><br>
        Due to the immense stress and pressure Anjanee is under, she eventually commits suicide. As previously
        mentioned, her father and brothers didn’t support her education and Anjanee was falling behind. Consequently,
        Anjanee stops believing she could ever live differently and gives up. As the novel nears its end, it is made
        known that Anjanee drank poison. She could no longer bear to live with the fact that she will be just like her
        mother — at least that is what she believes. She cannot possibly move out and earn money if she cannot even
        manage to pass two math exams. The self-doubt Anjanee begins to develop takes control of her and her confidence
        cannot increase with teachers like Mrs. Lopez always tearing her down. As a result, Anjanee gave up on her dream
        and thus gave up on life.
        <br><br>
        A narrative technique used in this novel to explore the characters’ desire to escape is foreshadowing. One
        instance of foreshadowing was when Anjanee said she would rather die than become like her mother. This explores
        the desire to escape because it gives the reader insight into Anjanee’s state of mind and her circumstances.
        Although at this stage of the novel the reader does not yet know that Anjanee is going to commit suicide, the
        reader does know that Anjanee wants so much to not be like her mother that life is not worth living if that is
        where she is going to end up, which hints at the desire to escape. Furthermore, it lets the reader know that it
        is a possibility that if she ends up like her mother, she will kill herself. Other instances of foreshadowing
        are also used that suggest this, but Anjanee’s statement is the most significant.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, Anjanee’s desire to not be like her mother led her to commit suicide. Additionally, foreshadowing
        is used to explore the desire to escape, especially in the case of Anjanee.
